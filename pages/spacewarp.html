					<h5>Introduction</h5>
					<p>Spacewarp VR is a proof of concept data visualization tool developed as part of a group project for Disney Research, 
						facilitated by Edinburgh Napier University. The goal of the project was to explore the usefulness of a 'document lens' 
						in virtual reality.
					</p>
					<p>The document lens is designed to help the user better navigate various graphs by letting the user zoom in to parts of 
						them, yet still showing the bigger picture around the point of interest to preserve context. To do this, a shader program 
						is used to warp an image of a virtual camera in the fragment stage of the graphics pipeline.
					</p>
					
					<h5>The Team</h5>
					<p>As mentioned before, this was a group project and therefore was made as a team effort. The team consisted of six people, 
						later dropping down to five, as one member had left due to personal reasons. I was one of two main programmers in the 
						group and I was responsible for making the lens itself. There was also a project manager, SCRUM master, asset creator, 
						and the other programmer. The contributions of all members of the team and smooth management made this project a success.
					</p>
					
					<h5>Result</h5>
					<p>Despite one member of the team leaving in the middle of the project, the development went rather smoothly. At the end 
						of the project the client was happy with the product and our project was the second best executed project in the school 
						of computing.
					</p>
					<p>During the course of the project I learned to work with VR and how Unity 3D handles the graphics pipeline. I also got some 
						experience working as part of a team.
