					<h5>Introduction</h5>
					<p>This project was done in collaboration with Grant Anderson, a fellow student, as part of the Games Engineering module. 
						The goal was to gain an understanding of game engine programming as well as making a game from start to finish. 
						Both me and my colleague participated in all parts of the project from writing the design document to programming.
					</p>
					
					<h5>The game</h5>
					<p>The game is a top-down spaceship battle for 1 or 2 players. The movement is designed to adhere to Newton's first law. 
						The ship players control has 6 thrusters which apply force on the ship when activated. Each player has three weapons 
						and a defensive turret for shooting down projectiles. The first player to destroy the opponent's ship wins.
					</p>
					<p>The fun of the game comes from trying to balance defense and offense, and using movement to supplement both.
					</p>
					<h5>The engine</h5>
					<p>The engine for the game was programmed from scratch over the course of the same GamesEngineering module. Two large parts 
						of the engine used free libraries so a greater focus could be given to engine architecture. Those parts are the graphics 
						system, which uses SFML, and physics system - using Box2D.
					</p>
					<p>The engine is designed to use the Entity-Component model at it's core. This means that every object in the game is an entity 
						and every behavior, attribute of an object, etc. is a component. This allows for greater flexibility when making a game. It also 
						makes the object and component hierarchy intuitive for developers.
					</p>
					<h5>Lessons learned</h5>
					<p>The biggest lesson is that polish takes time and lots of testing. While the final game had a few bugs, the biggest issue at the end 
						was the lack of tuning for various game mechanics like weapon damage, speed, and most of all the ships were just to difficult to control. 
						The animation for engine burn is very hard to spot, which makes it difficult to see which way the player is accelerating.
					</p>
					<p>On the bright side, working with a partner was very helpful. Besides the obvious advantage of being able to do more work over the 
						alloted time, having a second opinion helped plan the development of the game.
					</p>
